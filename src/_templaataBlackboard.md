# Project **`Blackboard`**

*This blackboard serves as the central knowledge hub for the project. It contains all relevant information, updates, and links to the actual files within the project directory.*
The blackboard is organized into several sections which are always being updated separately from each other.

## **`1. Shared Section`**

### User Request: *HumanInput*
    - write me a database handler in C++ with records bound to a std::string key as identifier. each record has an integer ID and 0 or more rows containing (string) name and (string) value. each operation with record has a unix-like timestamp and the operation names and timestamps must be stored and retrievable. implement basic operations for adding, removing and modifying records, but also design the DB handler robust enough so that it is capable of providing all the rows with values beginning with "||"

### Architectonical Design - Data Structures *DevBoard*
- class Record, std::unordered_map, std::string_view

### Algorythmic challenges identified *DevBoard*
- no recursion, avoid string copy in operations

### Design Patterns - suggested implementation approach *DevBoard*
- 

### `Refined Coding Tasks` *DevBoard*

* Title: PlaceholderTitle

  - Feature to implement
  - Acceptance Criteria
  - Filename for new file

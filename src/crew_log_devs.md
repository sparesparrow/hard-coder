Initiate Problem Definition: Objective: Clearly articulate the problem that needs to be solved. Actions: Gather relevant information about the project requirements and constraints. Engage with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations. Document the problem statement in a clear and concise manner. 2. Research and Select Design Pattern: Objective: Identify and select the most appropriate design pattern that aligns with the problem defined. Actions: Review common design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.) relevant to the problem domain. Analyze the pros and cons of each pattern in relation to the defined problem. Make a decision on the best-fit pattern and document the justification for this choice. 3. Create Detailed Coding Tasks: Objective: Break down the solution into manageable coding tasks. Actions: Identify major components or modules of the solution based on the selected design pattern. For each component/module, outline specific coding tasks (e.g., 'Implement User Authentication', 'Create Database Schema', etc.). Assign estimated timeframes and resources needed for each task to ensure comprehensive planning. 4. Review and Finalize Outputs: Objective: Ensure clarity and completeness of the defined problem, selected pattern, and coding tasks. Actions: Conduct a review session with stakeholders to validate the problem definition and selected pattern. Revise any tasks based on feedback received and finalize the documentation for future reference.2024-08-21 12:01:30: status=started

**1. Objectives:**
   - The primary objective is to develop a robust software solution that is user-friendly, scalable, and maintainable. The solution must integrate seamlessly with existing systems and adhere to industry best practices for security and performance.

**2. Functional Requirements:**
   - User interface for data input.
   - Process input data and perform necessary computations.
   - Generate output in formats like JSON, XML, or user-friendly reports.
   - Include error handling for invalid inputs.
   - Support user authentication and authorization for sensitive data.

**3. Non-Functional Requirements:**
   - **Performance:** Respond to user actions within 2 seconds.
   - **Scalability:** Handle increased loads for future growth.
   - **Security:** Comply with security standards (e.g., OWASP Top Ten).
   - **Usability:** Intuitive and accessible user interface.

**4. Constraints:**
   - **Time Constraints:** Completion within 4 weeks.
   - **Budget Constraints:** Stay within allocated budget.
   - **Technical Constraints:** Use specific technologies (e.g., JavaScript, Python, React).

# Project Documentation

## Record.h

### Description
The `Record` class is designed to hold an integer ID and a collection of name-value pairs. It provides methods for adding, removing, and modifying rows in the record. Additionally, each operation logs a timestamp and the operation name to ensure traceability.

### Code

```cpp
// Record.h
#ifndef RECORD_H
#define RECORD_H

#include <string>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>

class Record {
public:
    Record(int id) : id(id) {}

    void addRow(const std::string& name, const std::string& value) {
        rows[name] = value;
        logOperation("Add Row");
    }

    void removeRow(const std::string& name) {
        rows.erase(name);
        logOperation("Remove Row");
    }

    void modifyRow(const std::string& name, const std::string& newValue) {
        if (rows.find(name) != rows.end()) {
            rows[name] = newValue;
            logOperation("Modify Row");
        }
    }

    const std::string& getRow(const std::string& name) const {
        return rows.at(name);
    }

private:
    int id;
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> rows;
    std::vector<std::string> log;

    void logOperation(const std::string& operation) {
        time_t now = time(0);
        char* dt = ctime(&now);
        log.push_back(operation + " at " + dt);
    }
};

#endif // RECORD_H
```

## DatabaseHandler.h

### Description
The `DatabaseHandler` class manages records using `std::unordered_map` with `std::string` as the key. It provides methods for adding, removing, and modifying records. Each operation logs a timestamp and the operation name.

### Code

```cpp
// DatabaseHandler.h
#ifndef DATABASEHANDLER_H
#define DATABASEHANDLER_H

#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <ctime>
#include <iostream>
#include "Record.h"

class DatabaseHandler {
public:
    void addRecord(const std::string& key, int id) {
        records[key] = Record(id);
        logOperation("Add Record");
    }

    void removeRecord(const std::string& key) {
        records.erase(key);
        logOperation("Remove Record");
    }

    void modifyRecord(const std::string& key, const std::string& rowName, const std::string& newValue) {
        if (records.find(key) != records.end()) {
            records[key].modifyRow(rowName, newValue);
            logOperation("Modify Record");
        }
    }

    Record& getRecord(const std::string& key) {
        return records.at(key);
    }

private:
    std::unordered_map<std::string, Record> records;
    std::vector<std::string> log;

    void logOperation(const std::string& operation) {
        time_t now = time(0);
        char* dt = ctime(&now);
        log.push_back(operation + " at " + dt);
    }
};

#endif // DATABASEHANDLER_H
```

## DatabaseHandler.cpp

### Description
This file contains the implementation of the methods defined in `DatabaseHandler.h`. It ensures that the class can handle operations and maintain a log of operations.

### Code

```cpp
// DatabaseHandler.cpp
#include "DatabaseHandler.h"

// Implementation of methods is already provided in the header file
```

## main.cpp

### Description
The main function demonstrates the usage of the `DatabaseHandler` and `Record` classes. It includes basic operations like adding, modifying, and removing records and displays the results.

### Code

```cpp
// main.cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "DatabaseHandler.h"

int main() {
    DatabaseHandler dbHandler;

    // Add records
    dbHandler.addRecord("Record1", 1);
    dbHandler.addRecord("Record2", 2);

    // Modify records
    dbHandler.modifyRecord("Record1", "Name", "Alice");
    dbHandler.modifyRecord("Record2", "Name", "Bob");

    // Display records
    std::cout << "Record1 Name: " << dbHandler.getRecord("Record1").getRow("Name") << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Record2 Name: " << dbHandler.getRecord("Record2").getRow("Name") << std::endl;

    // Remove a record
    dbHandler.removeRecord("Record1");

    return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion
The provided code implements the `Record` and `DatabaseHandler` classes as specified. The `Record` class manages rows of name-value pairs and logs operations with timestamps. The `DatabaseHandler` class manages multiple records identified by string keys and logs operations similarly. The `main.cpp` file demonstrates the usage of these classes through basic operations.

# README

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple database management system with two main classes: `Record` and `DatabaseHandler`. The `Record` class represents individual records with an ID and multiple rows of data (name-value pairs). The `DatabaseHandler` class manages a collection of records and provides methods to add, remove, modify, and retrieve records.

## Classes and Methods

### Record Class

The `Record` class is defined in `Record.h` and includes the following methods:

- **Constructor**: Initializes a `Record` with a given ID.
- **addRow**: Adds a new row with a name-value pair.
- **modifyRow**: Modifies an existing row identified by its name.
- **getRow**: Retrieves the value associated with a given row name.
- **getAllRows**: Returns all rows as a vector of name-value pairs.
- **getOperationHistory**: Retrieves the history of operations performed on the record along with their timestamps.
- **logOperation**: A private method to log operations with their corresponding timestamps.

### DatabaseHandler Class

The `DatabaseHandler` class is defined in `DatabaseHandler.h` and includes the following methods:

- **addRecord**: Adds a new record if the key does not already exist.
- **removeRecord**: Removes a record identified by the key, with error handling for non-existent keys.
- **modifyRecord**: Modifies a record by adding a new row, with error handling for non-existent records.
- **retrieveRowsWithPrefix**: Retrieves all rows from a record whose values start with "||".

## Usage Example

The `main.cpp` file demonstrates the usage of the `DatabaseHandler` and `Record` classes. The sample code includes test cases for adding, modifying, and retrieving records.

```cpp
#include "DatabaseHandler.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    DatabaseHandler dbHandler;

    // Add records
    dbHandler.addRecord("rec1", 1);
    dbHandler.addRecord("rec2", 2);

    // Modify records
    dbHandler.modifyRecord("rec1", "name1", "value1");
    dbHandler.modifyRecord("rec1", "name2", "||value2");
    dbHandler.modifyRecord("rec2", "name1", "||value3");

    // Retrieve rows with prefix "||"
    auto rowsWithPrefix = dbHandler.retrieveRowsWithPrefix("rec1");
    std::cout << "Rows with prefix '||' in rec1:" << std::endl;
    for (const auto& row : rowsWithPrefix) {
        std::cout << row.first << ": " << row.second << std::endl;
    }

    // Remove a record
    dbHandler.removeRecord("rec1");

    return 0;
}
```

## Compilation

To compile the project, you can use the following command:

```sh
g++ -o database main.cpp DatabaseHandler.cpp
```

This will generate an executable named `database`.

## Conclusion

This project provides a basic implementation of a database management system with functionality to add, remove, modify, and retrieve records. The `Record` and `DatabaseHandler` classes are designed to be efficient and handle edge cases appropriately. The provided sample code in `main.cpp` demonstrates the usage of these classes and their methods.

# DatabaseHandler Project

## Overview
This project implements a database handler in C++ to manage records identified by a `std::string` key. Each record contains an integer ID and multiple rows with string name-value pairs. Each operation on the records is timestamped with a Unix-like timestamp. The implementation supports adding, removing, and modifying records and allows retrieval of all rows with values starting with "||".

## Design
The project uses the Command Pattern to encapsulate operations as objects, allowing for parameterization and queuing of requests.

### Classes
- **Record**: Represents a single record with an integer ID, a map of name-value pairs, and a timestamp.
- **DatabaseHandler**: Manages a collection of records and provides methods to add, remove, modify records, and retrieve records based on specific criteria.
- **Command**: An interface for executing operations.
- **AddCommand, RemoveCommand, ModifyCommand**: Concrete command classes implementing the `execute` method.
- **CommandInvoker**: Manages and executes commands in sequence.

## Usage
### Adding a Record
```cpp
DatabaseHandler dbHandler;
dbHandler.addRecord("key1", 1);
```

### Modifying a Record
```cpp
dbHandler.modifyRecord("key1", "name1", "value1");
```

### Removing a Record
```cpp
dbHandler.removeRecord("key1");
```

### Retrieving Records with Specific Values
```cpp
auto records = dbHandler.getRecordsWithValuesStartingWith("||");
```

## Testing
The project includes unit tests to validate the functionality of the DatabaseHandler. The tests cover adding, removing, modifying records, and retrieving specific rows.

### Running Tests
Compile and run `TestDatabaseHandler.cpp` to execute the tests.
```sh
g++ -o test TestDatabaseHandler.cpp DatabaseHandler.cpp Record.cpp
./test
```

# Blackboard Database Handler

This project implements a C++ database handler that uses `std::string` keys for record identification. Each record consists of an integer ID and multiple rows of name-value pairs. The handler supports operations to add, remove, and modify records, while logging operation names and timestamps for audit purposes.

## High-Level Architecture
- **Data Structures**:
  - `Record`: Represents a single record with an ID and rows of name-value pairs.
  - `std::unordered_map<std::string, Record>`: Used to efficiently store and retrieve records by their string keys.

## Design Patterns Used
- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulates operations as objects, enabling logging and undo functionality.
- **Factory Method**: Used for creating `Record` instances, separating creation logic from handling logic.

## Implementation Details
- Use `std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string>>` for storing name-value pairs within `Record`.
- Implement basic operations in a way that avoids recursion and minimizes string copying.

## Basic Operations
- **Add Record**: Adds a new record with the given key and initializes it with an ID and rows.
- **Remove Record**: Deletes a record identified by the key.
- **Modify Record**: Updates an existing record's rows.
- **Log Operations**: Each operation should log its name and a Unix-like timestamp.

## Querying
- Implement a method to retrieve all rows where values start with '||'.

## Class Definitions and Method Signatures
The project consists of three main classes: `Record`, `DatabaseHandler`, and `LogManager`.

### Record Class
Represents a database record with the following properties:
- `int id`: a unique identifier for the record.
- `std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string>> rows`: a collection of name-value pairs to store the record's data.

### DatabaseHandler Class
Responsible for managing multiple `Record` objects. It provides the following methods:
- `void addRecord(const Record& record)`: adds a new record to the database.
- `bool removeRecord(int id)`: removes a record by its unique id, returning true if successful.
- `bool modifyRecord(int id, const std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string>>& newRows)`: modifies an existing record with new data.

### LogManager Class
Responsible for logging operations performed on the database. It provides the following methods:
- `void logOperation(const std::string& operation, const std::string& timestamp)`: logs the operation with a timestamp.

For data storage and manipulation, use the C++ Standard Library containers such as `std::vector` and `std::map` where necessary. The Observer design pattern is suitable for notifying `LogManager` when changes are made in `DatabaseHandler`.

## **`1. Shared Section`**

### User Request: *HumanInput*
    - write me a database handler in C++ with records bound to a std::string key as identifier. each record has an integer ID and 0 or more rows containing (string) name and (string) value. each operation with record has a unix-like timestamp and the operation names and timestamps must be stored and retrievable. implement basic operations for adding, removing and modifying records, but also design the DB handler robust enough so that it is capable of providing all the rows with values beginning with "||"

## Steps to Execute:
1. Initialize the Tool: Load the FileReadTool with the specified parameters to access ../workspace/Blackboard.md.
2. Read the Content: Use FileReadTool to call the read a file's content() function. This will retrieve the content from the Blackboard.md file.
3. Process the Content: Once the content is read, analyze and structure it into a comprehensible format. This may involve:
   - Identifying sections and subsections.
   - Highlighting key points, features, or requirements mentioned in the document.
   - Organizing the content logically for further use.
4. Output the Processed Content: Format the structured content in a way that can be easily referenced and utilized by other agents.

**Problem Definition:**
1. **Database Handler Requirements:**
   - Each record is identified by a `std::string` key.
   - Each record contains:
     - An integer ID.
     - Zero or more rows, each containing a `(string) name` and `(string) value`.
   - Each operation (add, remove, modify) must have a Unix-like timestamp.
   - Operations and their timestamps must be stored and retrievable.
   - The handler should support basic operations (add, remove, modify) and provide all rows with values beginning with "||".

**Design Pattern Selection:**
- **Command Pattern**

**Refined Coding Tasks:**
1. **Title: Define Data Structures**
   - **Feature to implement:** Define the `Record`, `Row`, `Operation`, and `DatabaseHandler` classes.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Classes should be defined with appropriate member variables and methods.
   - **Filename for new file:** `database_handler.h`

2. **Title: Implement Add Operation**
   - **Feature to implement:** Implement the add operation in the `DatabaseHandler` class.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Should be able to add a record and store the operation with a timestamp.
   - **Filename for new file:** `database_handler.cpp`

3. **Title: Implement Remove Operation**
   - **Feature to implement:** Implement the remove operation in the `DatabaseHandler` class.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Should be able to remove a record and store the operation with a timestamp.
   - **Filename for new file:** `database_handler.cpp`

4. **Title: Implement Modify Operation**
   - **Feature to implement:** Implement the modify operation in the `DatabaseHandler` class.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Should be able to modify a record and store the operation with a timestamp.
   - **Filename for new file:** `database_handler.cpp`

5. **Title: Retrieve Rows with Specific Values**
   - **Feature to implement:** Implement functionality to retrieve rows with values beginning with "||".
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Should be able to retrieve and return the appropriate rows.
   - **Filename for new file:** `database_handler.cpp`

6. **Title: Store and Retrieve Operations**
   - **Feature to implement:** Implement functionality to store and retrieve operations and their timestamps.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Should be able to store each operation with its timestamp and retrieve them when needed.
   - **Filename for new file:** `database_handler.cpp`2024-08-21 20:08:56: status=completed

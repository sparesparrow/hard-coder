The **developers** push their completed code to the **`blackboard`**, which the **`testers`** then validate. Once validated, the BlackboardWriter moves the code to the locked section, and the DiagramGenerator updates the diagrams accordingly.

The **`human`** operator can manually update the **`Blackboard`**, locking sections or adding new **`tasks`**. The **`Blackboard`** **`Crew`** then automatically integrates these updates into the workflow, ensuring all teams are informed and aligned.

This design allows for an automated, yet flexible, workflow where **`human`** intervention is minimal but impactful, ensuring that the project remains on track and all teams work harmoniously together.

The **`Agent Manager`** oversees all the activities within the **`Blackboard`** **`Crew`**, managing the flow of **`tasks`**, prioritizing critical updates, and ensuring that the **`Blackboard`** remains consistent and up-to-date.


### `Developers` **`Crew`**:

  - Focuses on problem definition, design patterns, coding, and documentation.
  - Sends completed code and documentation to the **`Blackboard`** for integration.
  - Responds to new **`tasks`** or bug reports generated by the Testers and managed by the **`Agent Manager`**.

### `Testers` **`Crew`**:

  - Focuses on testing, bug fixing, and validating outputs.
  - Sends validated results to the **`Blackboard`**.
  - Receives new testing **`tasks`** or bug reports via the **`Agent Manager`** based on the updates from the **Developers** or **`human`** operator.

### `Blackboard` **`Crew`**:

- The **`Blackboard`** **`Crew`** is responsible for updating the **`Blackboard`**.md, generating diagrams, and locking approved sections. This **`crew`** is the central point for aggregating results from the **Developers** and Testers.
- Focuses on maintaining and updating the **`Blackboard`**. Manages updates from both **Developers** and Testers. Ensures that the **`Blackboard`** reflects the current state of the project and communicates critical updates back to the other crews.
- **`Agents`**:  
    * BlackboardWriter: Responsible for aggregating and writing validated content from **Developers** and Testers into the **`Blackboard`**.
    * DiagramUpdater: Generates and updates Mermaid diagrams based on the current content of the **`Blackboard`**.
    * SectionLocking: Locks sections of the **`Blackboard`** after **`human`** approval, ensuring no further automated changes can be made to those sections.

### `Agent Manager` **`Crew`**:

- Role: Oversees and coordinates the actions of all **`agents`** within the **`Blackboard`** **`Crew`**. Acts as a mediator between the three crews, ensuring that all actions are synchronized and that the **`Blackboard`** reflects the latest project state.
- Responsibilities:
  * Schedule and prioritize **`tasks`**.
  * Resolve conflicts between **`agents`** (e.g., race conditions, conflicting updates).
  * Manage updates from the **`human`** operator, disseminating new **`tasks`** or changes to the appropriate crews.
  * Monitor the consistency and accuracy of the **`Blackboard`**.

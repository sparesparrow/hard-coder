Problem defined, pattern selected, and coding tasks created.

**Problem Definition:**
1. **Database Handler Requirements:**
   - Each record is identified by a `std::string` key.
   - Each record contains:
     - An integer ID.
     - Zero or more rows, each containing a `(string) name` and `(string) value`.
   - Each operation (add, remove, modify) must have a Unix-like timestamp.
   - Operations and their timestamps must be stored and retrievable.
   - The handler should support basic operations (add, remove, modify) and provide all rows with values beginning with "||".

**Design Pattern Selection:**
- **Command Pattern**

**Refined Coding Tasks:**
1. **Title: Define Data Structures**
   - **Feature to implement:** Define the `Record`, `Row`, `Operation`, and `DatabaseHandler` classes.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Classes should be defined with appropriate member variables and methods.
   - **Filename for new file:** `database_handler.h`

2. **Title: Implement Add Operation**
   - **Feature to implement:** Implement the add operation in the `DatabaseHandler` class.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Should be able to add a record and store the operation with a timestamp.
   - **Filename for new file:** `database_handler.cpp`

3. **Title: Implement Remove Operation**
   - **Feature to implement:** Implement the remove operation in the `DatabaseHandler` class.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Should be able to remove a record and store the operation with a timestamp.
   - **Filename for new file:** `database_handler.cpp`

4. **Title: Implement Modify Operation**
   - **Feature to implement:** Implement the modify operation in the `DatabaseHandler` class.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Should be able to modify a record and store the operation with a timestamp.
   - **Filename for new file:** `database_handler.cpp`

5. **Title: Retrieve Rows with Specific Values**
   - **Feature to implement:** Implement functionality to retrieve rows with values beginning with "||".
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Should be able to retrieve and return the appropriate rows.
   - **Filename for new file:** `database_handler.cpp`

6. **Title: Store and Retrieve Operations**
   - **Feature to implement:** Implement functionality to store and retrieve operations and their timestamps.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:** Should be able to store each operation with its timestamp and retrieve them when needed.
   - **Filename for new file:** `database_handler.cpp`

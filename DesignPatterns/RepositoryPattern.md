# RepositoryPatternProject


## Overview

This project demonstrates the Repository Pattern, which is used to create an abstraction layer between the data access layer and the business logic layer of an application. The Repository pattern is often used in conjunction with the Unit of Work pattern to manage transactions.


## Project Structure

The project follows the Repository Pattern with clearly defined repositories for different data entities.

### Components

- **UserRepository**: Handles user data operations.
- **OrderRepository**: Handles order data operations.
- **UnitOfWork**: Manages transactions and coordinates the work of multiple repositories.
